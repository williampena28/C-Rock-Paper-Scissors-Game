rps game project

This program was made in Microsoft Visual Studio Community edition 2022

This will run through the terminal and read the inputs from
the terminal itself. The program will be run on an .exe 
file and that's howthe game will run. 

The player inputs will be parts into 2 parts;
	- 'STOP' & 'PLAY'
	- 'rock' 'paper' and 'scissors'

	'STOP' will stop and exit the program
	'PLAY' + 'rock'/'paper'/'scissors' will play
		with the corrisponding choice the player
		has typed.

I don't know how to generalize these tokens, so I'll
leave that for later. The program itself will either
choose the three options against the player and
depending on the outcome, either will win or a draw
will happen. 

The program's choice will completely a 1/3 chance to
go 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' and both chooses
from the program and player will be checked to see
who won the interaction.

As of 5/10/2022 this will only be a simple rock
paper scissors game with no score count to be
implemented yet.
